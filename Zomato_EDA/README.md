# 🍴 EDA using zomato resturanat dataset

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Zomato Restaurants dataset.  
The objective is to uncover insights about restaurants, customer preferences, ratings, locations, and pricing trends.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.  
- Understand the distribution of restaurant ratings.  
- Analyze the relationship between online ordering, restaurant types, and ratings.  
- Study cost distribution and its correlation with cuisines and locations.  
- Identify patterns and trends that can be useful for business decisions.

## 📊 Steps Followed
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Converted categorical values (e.g., Yes/No for online order).
